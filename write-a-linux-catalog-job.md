Introduce the catalog job design and know how to create a new parser and compose a new catalog task.

**Goals:**

\(1\)Understand the current catalog job design

\(2\)Understand how the parser is linked with the catalog job

\(3\)Understand how to login into Microkernel

\(4\)Microkernel operation

**Practice:**

\(1\)Create a new Linux catalog task for command “ls -al /”

-You need create a parser to parse the output and convert it into JSON.

-Store the catalog into source “lsroot”

-Create a new task for the new catalog job.

-Incorporate the new catalog into discovery graph, make sure the catalog is done when a new node is discovered.

-We will provide the parser’s unit-test, you need to make sure your code pass the unit-test.
