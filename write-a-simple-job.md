Introduce how to write a simple job.

**Goals:**

\(1\)Understand the general job code structure

**Practice:**

\(1\)Write a job to calculate the Fibonacci number

-The job should support an option “iterations”:

ØIf 0&lt; iterations &lt;= 100, the job should success and then print the result into console.

ØOtherwise, the job should fail.

-You need to compose the baseTask, Task, and graph.

-We will provide the unit-test for this job, you need to make sure your code pass the unit-test.

-\(Nice-to-Have\) Create a schema and make sure the “iterations” is a number and should be &lt;=100.
