RackHD serves as an abstraction layer between other M&O layers and the underlying physical hardware. Developers can use the RackHD API to create a user interface that serves as single point of access for managing hardware services regardless of the specific hardware in place.

RackHD has the ability to discover the existing hardware resources, catalog each component, and retrieve detailed telemetry information from each resource. The retrieved information can then be used to perform low-level hardware management tasks, such as BIOS configuration, OS installation, and firmware management.

RackHD sits between the other M&O layers and the underlying physical hardware devices. User interfaces at the higher M&O layers can request hardware services from RackHD. RackHD handles the details of connecting to and managing the hardware devices.

# Feature List

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Discovery and Cataloging | Discovers the compute, network, and storage resources and catalogs their attributes and capabilities. |
| Telemetry and Genealogy | Telemetry data includes genealogical details, such as hardware, revisions, serial numbers, and date of manufacture |
| Device Management | Powers devices on and off. Manages the firmware, power, OS installation, and base configuration of the resources. |
| Configuration | Configures the hardware per application requirements. This can range from the BIOS configuration on compute devices to the port configurations in a network switch. |
| Provisioning | Provisions a node to support the intended application workflow, for example lays down ESXi from an image repository. Reprovisions a node to support a different workload, for example changes the ESXi platform to Bare Metal CentOS. |
| Firmware Management | Manages all infrastructure firmware versioning. |
| Logging | Log information can be retrieved for particular elements or collated into a single timeline for multiple elements within the management neighborhood. |
| Environmental Monitoring | Aggregates environmental data from hardware resources. The data to monitor is configurable and can include power information, component status, fan performance, and other information provided by the resource. |
| Fault Detection | Monitors compute and storage devices for both hard and soft faults. Performs suitable responses based on pre-defined policies. |
| Analytics Data | Data generated by environmental and fault monitoring can be provided to analytic tools for analysis, particularly around predictive failure. |

























Give an overview introduction on RackHD, and draw a table or mind map to illustrate the full technical stack of RackHD. For each entry, give a general introduction, provide the useful link and recommended material.

**Goals:**

\(1\)Understand whatâ€™s RackHD

\(2\)Understand the RackHD teams

\(3\)Understand the RackHD open source development model

\(4\)Understand all materials you could reference to

\(5\)Understand the general technical stack of RackHD

\(6\)Understand the basic terms of SCRUM, such as epic, story, RAC, RI, .etc.

**Practice**

\(1\)Open Maglev portal page to check how many systems you can access.

\(2\)Setup all necessary accounts, including github, google group, slack, open confluence/jira

**Extend:**

\(1\)Read the RackHD readthedoc.
