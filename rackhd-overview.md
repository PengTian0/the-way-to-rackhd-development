# Overview

RackHD serves as an abstraction layer between other M&O layers and the underlying physical hardware. Developers can use the RackHD API to create a user interface that serves as single point of access for managing hardware services regardless of the specific hardware in place.

RackHD has the ability to discover the existing hardware resources, catalog each component, and retrieve detailed telemetry information from each resource. The retrieved information can then be used to perform low-level hardware management tasks, such as BIOS configuration, OS installation, and firmware management.

RackHD sits between the other M&O layers and the underlying physical hardware devices. User interfaces at the higher M&O layers can request hardware services from RackHD. RackHD handles the details of connecting to and managing the hardware devices.

# Feature List

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Discovery and Cataloging | Discovers the compute, network, and storage resources and catalogs their attributes and capabilities. |
| Telemetry and Genealogy | Telemetry data includes genealogical details, such as hardware, revisions, serial numbers, and date of manufacture |
| Device Management | Powers devices on and off. Manages the firmware, power, OS installation, and base configuration of the resources. |
| Configuration | Configures the hardware per application requirements. This can range from the BIOS configuration on compute devices to the port configurations in a network switch. |
| Provisioning | Provisions a node to support the intended application workflow, for example lays down ESXi from an image repository. Reprovisions a node to support a different workload, for example changes the ESXi platform to Bare Metal CentOS. |
| Firmware Management | Manages all infrastructure firmware versioning. |
| Logging | Log information can be retrieved for particular elements or collated into a single timeline for multiple elements within the management neighborhood. |
| Environmental Monitoring | Aggregates environmental data from hardware resources. The data to monitor is configurable and can include power information, component status, fan performance, and other information provided by the resource. |
| Fault Detection | Monitors compute and storage devices for both hard and soft faults. Performs suitable responses based on pre-defined policies. |
| Analytics Data | Data generated by environmental and fault monitoring can be provided to analytic tools for analysis, particularly around predictive failure. |

# Major Service Components

![](/assets/rackhd-major-service-components.png)

* ### ISC DHCP

This DHCP server provides IP addresses dynamically using the DHCP protocol. It is a critical component of a standard[\`Preboot Execution Environment \(PXE\)\`\_](http://rackhd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture.html#id2)process.

* ### MongoDB

The MongoDB provices the database for RackHD. RackHD is planing to support other kinds of databases.

* ### on-dhcp-proxy

The DHCP protocol supports getting additional data specifically for the PXE process from a secondary service that also responds on the same network as the DHCP server. The DHCP proxy service provides that information, generated dynamically from the workflow engine.

* ### on-tftp

TFTP is the common protocol used to initiate a PXE process. on-tftp is tied into the workflow engine to be able to dynamically provide responses based on the state of the workflow engine and to provide events to the workflow engine when servers request files via TFTP.

* ### on-http

on-http provides both the REST interface to the workflow engine and data model APIs as well as a communication channel and potential proxy for hosting and serving files to support dynamic PXE responses. RackHD commonly uses iPXE as its initial bootloader, loading remaining files for PXE booting via HTTP and using that communications path as a mechanism to control what a remote server will do when rebooting.

on-http also serves as the communication channel for the microkernel to support deep hardware interrogation, firmware updates, and other actions that can only be invoked directly on the hardware \(not through an out of band management channel\).

* ### on-syslog

on-syslog is a syslog receiver endpoint provideing annotated and structured logging from the hosts under management. It channels all syslog data sent to the host into the workflow engine.

* ### on-taskgraph

on-taskgraph is the workflow engine, driving actions on remote systems and processing workflows for machines being managed. Additionally, the workflow engine provides the engine for polling and monitoring.







Give an overview introduction on RackHD, and draw a table or mind map to illustrate the full technical stack of RackHD. For each entry, give a general introduction, provide the useful link and recommended material.
