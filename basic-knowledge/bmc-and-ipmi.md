* Intelligent Platform Management Interface, Baseboard Management Controller
* IPMI is a specifications that provides standardized hardware interfaces and abstraction

* 1998 v1.0, 2001 v1.5, 2004 v2.0

* The primary IPMI features include:

  * Monitoring \(supervision of the hardware\)
  * Recovery Control \(Recover/Restart the server\)
  * Logging \(protocol "out-of-range" states for the hardware\)
  * Inventory \(list of hardware inventory\)

* Avaiable even if system is powered down and no OS loaded

* IPMI Components
  * BMC \(Baseboard Management Controller\): The heart of IPMI
  * IPMB \(Intelligent Platform Management Bus\)
  * ICMB \(Intelligent Chassis Management Bus\)
* Some Data Types
  * SEL \(System Event Logging\)
  * SDR \(Sensor Data Record\)
  * Sensor
  * FRU \(Field Replaceable Unit\)
* System Interfaces

  * KCS

  * Lan

  * Others \(Serial, ...

* SOL \(Serial Over LAN\): Redirect data traffic to BMC serial port through an IPMI session
